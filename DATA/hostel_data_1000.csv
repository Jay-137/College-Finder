600,Dr. Sudhir Chandra Sur Institute of Technology & Sports Complex - [SURTECH],"2-3 students could very well stay in each room of the college hostel. The food was fairly good. If you want to take a hostel, you have to fill a separate form at the time of admission. And if a student does not want to take a hostel, he can easily get a pg, because there is no shortage of pug in dum dum."
600,Dr. Sudhir Chandra Sur Institute of Technology & Sports Complex - [SURTECH],"Hostel rooms are okay-ish, need to be upgraded with air-conditioning on summer days. The facilities provided are a bit dated and needs a lot of work to be done or just replace it with a new and improved one to provide a better standard of living. The hostel is out of the college campus which needs to be brought inside. Food is very vague same as the case with the rest of the colleges' hostels. The food for day scholars which can be bought aren't up to mark either. Small rooms in hostels accomodating 3 people which should be 2, 3rd yr and final yr students should be given separate rooms to study for campusing and job interviews. At least provide washrooms for each room. Overall needs a lot of work to be done in the hostel department as well the college campus, college classrooms."
