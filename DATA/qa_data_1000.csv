564,SRMIST Delhi NCR Campus,"Which is better in terms of placements: Manipal University (Jaipur), SRM (Ghaziabad), KIIT University, Amity University (Noida) or the IPU colleges?","According to my friend at SRM, the KTR campus of SRM is the best choice. If you consider factors like faculty, placements, and a lot more. The points below will provide you a brief overview of all the institutes stated above and the advantages of SRM over them.
SRM University has three campuses, first in Kattankulathur, second in Ramapuram, and third in Vadapalani. The campus in Kattankulathur (KTR) is marked as the best among them.
In SRM KTR, will make you a real engineer. It has excellent faculty, provides a lot of on-campus placement opportunities, and is also good in extra-curricular activities.
The other two campuses of SRM, Ramapuram, and Vadapalani, are somewhat satisfactory, but not as good as the KTR campus.
Talking about the NCR, the campus is quite far away from Delhi, which results in a lot of travel to and from Delhi on weekends.
The faculty of NCR is not that good and so students have to be dependent on self-study. The placements are decent because it is held in the Chennai (KTR) campus. But, the NCR campus has much lesser fees than the Chennai campus and so, it is considered better.
The Manipal University is called a happening campus, which provides excellent college life, extra-curricular activities, party culture, etc. But, students in Manipal University should be aware of the bad habits on campus and choose friends wisely for the same reason.
The fee structure in Manipal University is also on a slightly higher side. It provides average quality placement to students.

The placements occur when the students of the college focus and prepare themselves for that. 
The students studying at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana do not belong to the professional environment and do not have good communication skills. 
Most of the students are from the native places and some of them come from villages. 
The communication skills, hence, will not be improved if one decides to study at this institute. 
Although, education depends on the capability of the student. So if you are confident about yourself and can manage your education on your own no matter how the college is, then Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College of Ludhiana is the appropriate place for you."

Out of the two, LNCT is preferred more than the other colleges because some faculties of LNCT are brilliant and resourceful. They are cooperative and highly experienced.
If you think going through a revised copy of what the teachers taught will help you during exams, you are completely wrong. You as a student need to work on your academic skills, communication skills, presentation skills, etc. Teachers can provide you with the basic guidance but in the end it all matters on your hard work.

CGC Landran is ranked in 210-250 band by NIRF 2020 whereas DAVIET is ranked 100 by India Today.
Given below is a brief overview of the two colleges.

DAVIET fee structure is lower than CGC Landran. DAVIET has an average annual fee of Rs. 70,000 whereas CGC Landran has an average annual fee of Rs.96,000.
Scholarships:
CGC Landran offers merit scholarships, merit-means scholarships, scholarships for differently-abled students, etc.
DAVIET offers Post Matric Scholarships to eligible candidates from the reserved category as per the Punjab Govt/IKG PTU norm.
Placement:
CGC Landran has better placement (almost 100%) in IT/CSE department as compared to DAVIET Jalandhar and for core streams like Mechanical, Electrical etc both are equally good. On the other hand, DAVIET has a lower placement percentage but has a higher average salary as DAVIET does not allow mass recruiters which offer less than 3 LPA packages.
Every year top companies like Samsung, IBM, Microsoft, Dell etc visit both the campuses.
In terms of placement percentage, CGC Landran has led with 100% placement compared to DAVIET Jalandhar which has 85% placement.
The average package of both the colleges is the same 3.5 LPA.
The highest package of CGC Landran is 35 LPA whereas the highest package of DAVIET Jalandhar is only 10 LPA. As CGC is a group of institutions, it has advantages over the highest package data.
So, the choice of college purely depends on one’s priority. Placement wise CGC Landran has an edge over DAVIET but if you consider fee structure and campus location or exposure then DAVIET is better. DAVIET is located in Jalandhar city and hence has location advantage and better connectivity than CGC Landran. Academically both are equally good colleges and their average placement is similar. DAVIET has comparatively a smaller number of placements but quality placements and CGC has more placements from mass recruiters."

Bajaj, Greater Noida or Galgotias University?","Both G L Bajaj and Galgotias University are decent options for CS or IT branches. However, you will like to refer to the following points before choosing one
Choose G.L. Bajaj if you are self-motivated and determined to work hard because the institute has a rigid academic environment with many restrictions on attendance and such. Galgotia University on the other hand offers a huge sense of freedom with no restrictions at all. You are free to do whatever you want.
Another major factor to consider is the distance from Greater Noida. G.L. Bajaj is situated in the heart of Greater Noida, whereas Galgotias University is situated almost 15-17 Km from Greater Noida.
Honestly, the faculty pool of both colleges is below average. However, if I were to compare then G L Bajaj still has a handful of experienced professors
Addressing the elephant in the room, it can be said that the placement scenario isn't very different at both the colleges. Galgotias University is newly established but is doing quite well in terms of placements. Here is a comparative analysis of the placement scenario of both the colleges

The syllabus and especially the question paper is not the traditional type but rather stimulates you to think. 
They have a much advanced, updated curriculum and it is possible because they don’t come under any university and hence have the liberty to mold according to the latest industry standards.
Placement: (Winning Institution - Amrita University)
It is not easier to get placed from Amrita because you study in Amrita does not mean you will get high placements because the crowd in Amrita is more competitive. 
All those who missed out on JEE come to Amrita. Top companies like Microsoft, Facebook, CISCO recruit only from Amrita out of those mentioned.
Campus Life: (Winning Institution - Amrita University)
The clubs in Amrita are almost international, as it conducts the prestigious ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). Which itself is a benchmark to look for, acknowledging non-premier institutes like IITs, NITs, and BITs. 
The clubs in Amrita are more diverse and active. It's tech-fest ANOKHA is also much better.

Some points on JISCE being a better institution for BTech are as follows:
JISCE follows a concept of 'Flip Learning,' a rare mode of learning which gives an advantage in placement than JISU. It is the first of its kind in West Bengal.
At JISCE, about 140-150 CSE students got placed with Amazon, Capgemini and Wipro with an average package of 2.5-2.8 LPA. The highest package was INR 10 LPA offered by BYJUs. Over 80% of students got placed in 2020.
The major recruiters at JISU are Bandhan Bank, Cipla, and Flipkart.
JISCE has better lab facilities than JISU. It has over 57 laboratories with better infrastructure and are fully wifi enabled.
The CSE department of the JISCE promotes Digital Learning to save paperwork, keeping in alignment with the digital age.
JIS College of Engineering has a highly qualified faculty of over 20-25 members. They are better compared to JIS University.
The only negative point is that the campus life is boring at JISU, and ragging is rampant as well.There are many colleges under the JIS group and if you compare JIS colleges with others in terms of faculty, placements, salary packages offered, JISCE gets the first position."

Malla Reddy is the best choice for placements.
Guru Nanak is the best choice for a college with excellent faculty, infrastructure, and hostel facilities.
Vardhaman, BV Raju is ideal for college architecture and development.
VNR is ideal for colleges with stringent rules and regulations.
It's not about the college when it comes to engineering; it's about how you learn and how much effort you put in. Colleges only teach you 10% of what you need to know; the other 90% must be learned outside of the classroom and through hard work. Any college will suffice if you have a strong interest in your program and are serious about pursuing a career in engineering."

984,SRM University Vadapalani Campus,"Is it worth doing bcom accounting and finance in SRM institute of science and technology Chennai. What's the scope and could you please give me full details like exams we should persuade, college etc.","SRM Vadapalani is any day better than JUET Guna. After discussing with some students of these colleges, I can say that, even though JUET has an amazing placement record and infrastructure, SRM has a bigger brand value than the Jaypee group.
SRM has highly qualified faculties with few of them having prior industrial experiences. They strive to keep the environment of SRM highly competitive.
You will definitely get a better crowd at SRM where there is a high level of peer-to-peer learning when compared to JUET.
Placement statistics of SRM speak for themselves.
Even in location, academic curriculum, and campus infrastructure wise SRM leads the list.
The only factor that favors JUET Guna is if you don't prefer to study down south on SRM main campus.
In that case, you can still opt for CSE at JUET which has a decent placement. The average CTC there stands at 11 LPA. But it's not the same in the case of other branches.
Categories SRM Vadapalani JUET Guna
Course Fee 9.1 lakhs 7.28 lakhs
Highest CTC 28 LPA 20 LPA
Average CTC 10-12 LPA 9 LPA
Recruiting Companies TCS, Google, IBM, Wipro, etc. Infosys, Cognizant, Tech Mahindra, HCL, etc.
To sum up, SRM must be your first preference among the two. It offers you a better opportunity, exposure, and placements. The quality of teaching is amazing. Overall SRM gives you a better ROI for the fee you pay."
